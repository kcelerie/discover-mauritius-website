# Image Shotlist — Discover Mauritius

**Purpose:** the complete brief of every photograph the website needs (Pending #3). Until real
photos arrive, each slot renders as an on-brand gradient placeholder sized correctly, with the
"intended subject" shown as a hint and used as the accessible alt text.

**How to supply:** drop files into `/public/images/...` and set the `src` on the matching slot in
`/content/*` (e.g. `hero.src = "/images/tours/south-hero.jpg"`). `<SmartImage>` then swaps the
placeholder for an optimized `next/image` automatically — no code changes.

**Format guidance**
- Prefer landscape/wide originals at high resolution; we generate responsive/AVIF/WebP sizes.
- Natural, warm colour treatment (no heavy filters/duotone). Real Mauritius locations only.
- Avoid text in images. Leave some "quiet" area in hero shots for headline overlay.
- Licensing: client's own photography preferred; otherwise correctly licensed stock (never scraped).
